Apk changer is a command line program for modifying apk files. It`s similar to apk manager, but have more options.

Features: 
 - Normal and Advanced Mode.
 - Multicore support(much faster than oher tools in batch operations and image optimization) - supports up to 6 cores
 - Decompile/Compile selected part of apk's.(Batch mode supported, framework dependent decompiling supported too)
 - Optimize pngs inside apk's(including .9.pngs).(Batch mode supported)
 - Zipalign apks
 - Sign apks(Batch mode supported)
 - Adb logcat with logcat options(via WiFi or usb cable)
 - Two versions of apktool and aapt(1.4.3 and 1.3.1)-if error occurs while decompiling my program will try too use alternative version and will compile your apk with that version that was used for decompiling
 - Three languages at the moment(Russian, English and Dutch) - if you want to translate my progam into your own language just let me know
 - Settings (Compression level, Heap size, optimization level, apktool version, language...) - program saves all settings - no need to enter them every time you starts it.
 - Error detection. If error occured, program reports about it
 - Log (For batch Decompilation/Compilation program creates two logs. First is full and second shows only in with what apks occured errors).
 - Decompile/Compile jar files(framework files)
 - Decompile/Compile m10 files
 - All stuff i forgot
 - If you need other functions - let me know and i`ll try to add them in future versions
