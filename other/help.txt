Settings
1)Compression level:
-Global compression level - compression level for most of files inside apk
-Image compression - compression level for image files(such as png, jpg) - recomended 0,
images are already compressed files, so they don`t need compression
-Xml compression - compression for xml files
-Dex compression - compression for dex file(consist of smali-files, when unpacked)
-ARSC compression - compression for arsc file(consist of values files)

2)Cache size - java heap size
3)Optimization level - optimization level for images inside apk
-9 is the best optimization level - but it the most slow, 1 - lowest optimization level, but the most fast.
4)Apktool - select version of apktool which you want use as default
5)Language - select language of a program
6)Connect adb to wifi - you can connect adb via wifi to your phone & install programs, use logcat via wifi
7)Delete unnecessary files - you can turn this option on for autodeleting unneeded files from apk.
Folders which will be deleted defined in ufl file (unnecessary folder list) - you can find it in other\fl folder and edit with any text editor(in this file
can be defined any folders – you can delete languages, images and so on. )
Example: If you have device with hdpi resolution and you don`t need ldpi, mdpi and xhdpi support in apk – 
you can define drawable-ldpi, drawable-mdpi and drawable-xhdpi folders in ufl list. If you don`t need Russian translation in apk – you can define values-ru folder in ufl file.
You can create custom ufl file for apk files, that will overwrite  default list( For this you must create new file(or copy default list) and rename it as: 
file name + _ + ufl . 
Example: If you want create custom list for Phone.apk you should create Phone_ufl file in other\fl folder and define there all folders that you want to delete.
Program will notify you that custom lis found – it will show “Found custom unnecessary folder list for Phone.apk” during decompilation. )
8)Framework version - here you can select framework which will be used as default for decompiling apks.
list of frameworks defined in frameworkslist.txt in other\frameworks folder.
You can add there your own frameworks(up to six files – miui has six framework files, new htc roms has four) or delete default.
Example:
We will add htc framework from my own htc rom:
-Copy all apk files from system/framework folder(you can rename them as you wish, but don`t use spaces) to other frameworks folder in the program
In my rom i have framework-res.apk & com.htc.resources.apk. I`ll rename them to framework-res_my.apk & com.htc.resources_my.apk
-Now we must add our frameworks to frameworkslist.txt.
Open frameworkslist.txt with text editor. Now we must add framework name(will be shown in program - i will use "MY ROM"), then |,
framework tag(apktool will use it - don`t use spaces here. I wiil use "my"), again |, then you must add eight framework names which you copied before  - if you have
only one or two frameworks - write no.
As result we have such line in frameworkslist.txt:

MY ROM|my|framework-res_my.apk|com.htc.resources_my.apk|no|no|no|no|no|no

-Now open program, goto settings, select Framework version and reinstall framework files after this you can select your framework in the program
9)Signature key - key which will be used for apk signing
10)Text color - color of the text which program will use
11)Notifications - turn on or off program notifications
